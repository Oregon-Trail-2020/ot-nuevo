                The Oregon Trail is a series of educational computer games. Our team was inspired to recreate our favorite educational video game with a twist. The first game was originally developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and produced by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) in 1974. The game was designed to teach 8th grade school children about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail.

            <p> Fast forward to 2020. Oregon gains the most residents from California. On average, 39,320 Californians move to Oregon annually. But an average of 19,523 Oregonians also make the move south, leaving Oregon with a net gain of 19,797 new residents from California every year. In Oregon Trail Nuevo the player assumes the role of a driver relocating and is faced with a series of choice as they relocate from San Diego, California to Portland, Oregon.</p>
